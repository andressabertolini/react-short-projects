# About this app

This is a ReactJS project that brings recipes from an API, so you can search for many types of recipes and it will show recipe cards as results, with name and description, and you can click to visualize the external link with the full recipe page.

This was developed from a tutorial for study purposes: https://youtu.be/U9T6YkEDkMo
